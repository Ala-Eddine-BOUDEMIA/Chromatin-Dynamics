# The Genomic Organization of Histones in Eukaryotes

## Canonical Histones

- A total of 73 histone genes have been identified in humans, including 16 genes for histone H2A, 22 genes for histone H2B, 14 genes for histone H3, 15 genes for histone H4 and 6 genes for histone H1, along with the genes encoding for the testis-specific variants TSH2B.1, H3.1t and H1t.
- Chromosome 6 (HIST1 locus) contains the major cluster of these genes (55 genes, ∼ 80% of the total), while the other histones are located in two smaller clusters, the histone clusters 2 and 3 (HIST2 and HIST3 loci), on chromosome 1. At variance, the HIST4H4 gene, encoding for the H4 core histone, is present on chromosome 12 in histone cluster 4.
- Core histones present different subtypes: in particular, 11 isoforms for H2A, 14 for H2B (including the testis-specific variant TSH2B.1—Table 2), 3 for H3 (including the testis-specific variant H3.1t— Table 3) and 2 for H4, respectively.
- With the exception of HIST1H2BA and HIST1H4G, these isoforms display more than 90% of similarity with the corresponding core histones, therefore encoding for proteins with minimal structural changes.

## Non-canonical Histones

- Considering that the expression of non-canonical variants is regulated in a time- and tissue-dependent manner, this dynamic process is operational also during embryonic development and cell differentiation

## Histone H3 mutations

- The association between histone H3 K27M mutation and pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) was confirmed by many other studies
- In the last few years, the list of cancers known to carry mutations in H3 has progressively lengthened to include chondroblastoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, bladder cancer, melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia
- Although the most studied histone H3 mutations, such as K27M, K36M and G34 mutants, localize in the N-terminal domain and are thought to play their oncogenic role by perturbing the pattern of histone PTMs, there are also several residues in the globular domain, such as E97, E105 and R131 that have been found mutated at similar or even higher rates

### K27M

- The importance of histone H3 K27M mutation is underlined by the fact that it is the only histone mutation recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a marker for tumor classification
- K27M mutation was found primarily in H3F3A (about 75%), one of the two genes encoding the replication-independent H3.3, less frequently in the replication-dependent H3.1 (about 25%, mainly HIST1H3B and, to a lesser extent, HIST1H3C) and rarely in H3.2 (HIST2H3C)
- In DIPGs, K27M mutations have been associated with mutations in TP53, PDGFRA, ACVR1 and BCOR
- K27M mutation is associated with reduced H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 levels, increased H3K27ac and DNA hypomethylation and consequently to a loss of gene silencing
- The dominant effect of H3K27 mutations on methylation seems to be specific to K27M (and to a lesser extent K27I). Similar effects were observed when other known methylated lysine residues of histone H3, such as H3K9 and H3K36, undergo K-to-M transitions, suggesting this kind of mutation as a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in cancer and other pathologies

### K36M

- K36M mutation was discovered in 73 of 77 cases of chondroblastoma (95%). Interestingly, 90% of the mutations were found in H3F3B
- The mutation seems tumor type-specific as it was rarely found for example in bone cancers
- In addition, this mutation was found to be the only recurrent mutation in chondroblastoma
- H3K36M mutations at lower frequencies have also been reported in pediatric soft tissue sarcoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, bladder and colorectal cancer

### G34 mutations

- G34R/V mutations occur mainly in young adults and exclusively in tumors of the cerebral cortex
- The selective occurrence of K27M and G34R/V mutations in specific brain regions, as well as their prevalence in individuals of specific ages, suggests an exclusive developmental window and cell type that allow peculiar mutations in the young individual.
- H3.3G34R/V gliomas show early neuroprogenitor and interneuron-like transcriptomic signatures, while hindbrain and later neuroprogenitor signatures were found in H3.3K27M tumors
- G34R/V mutations were found to be associated with ATRX/DAXX mutations in pHGG
- G34W mutations of histone H3.3 have been observed also in a cancer syndrome involving pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) and GCTB, where the mutation is thought to arise postzygotically

## Histone H2B mutations

- Mutated H2B residues lie mainly in the globular domain and, in most cases, are not sites of known PTMs
- E76 and E113 of histone H2B are among the 5 most commonly mutated histone residues
- E76 was identified as the most mutated histone residue in cancer
- E76K is prevalently found in bladder and head and neck cancers targeting preferentially some genes of the Hist1 cluster (H2BC, H2BD, H2BF, H2BH and H2BI) is sufficient to distort the interface between H2B and H4 inducing nucleosome instability
- E113 is the second most mutated residue of histone H2B in cancer and one of the most mutated among all histone residues
- E113 mutations normally lead to E113K/Q transitions and seem to not involve specific H2B genes.
- F70 mutations target mainly Hist2 cluster genes (in particular HIST2H2BE), while E71 mutations prevalently Hist1 cluster genes
- The only frequently mutated PTMs-targeted H2B residue in cancer is E2, that is among the 3–4 most mutated H2B residues with the most frequent transitions being E2Q and E2K
- H2BG53 was identified as a frequent target of mutation in cancer, and a recent additional analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed the significant presence (4.5%) of G53D transition in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
- Other mutations of histone H2B were found in specific cancer types, such as the one producing G27A, E36G and M63K transitions in carcinosarcomas of the female genital tract and the one targeting S37 and Y38 in follicular lymphomas

## H2A mutations

- H2A mutations are commonly found in bladder cancer, endometrial carcinomas and head and neck carcinomas, although they have been described also in carcinomas of the female tract
- The most frequently mutated residue of histone H2A is E121, with the most represented transitions being E121Q, E121K and, to a lesser extent, E121D
- Frequent mutations target also R29 of histone H2A producing in most cases R29Q transitions.
- Other mutations have been identified in carcinomas of the female tract such as R4H and K16T, which target known post-translational modified residues, and E57Q, which is involved in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the H2A fold

## Histone H4 mutations

- R3 was identified as the most frequent mutated residue of histone H4, with R3C being the most common mutation and with a balanced distribution across the different H4 genes
- Interestingly, H4R3 PTMs, such as symmetric demethylation and citrullination, have been liked to transcriptional repression and response to DNA damage and their dysregulation was associated with cancer
- Additionally, D68 and R92 were identified among the most mutated histone H4 residues in cancer patients. Interestingly, these residues are known to play a pivotal role in the structural interactions between histone H2B and H4. These residues, indeed, establish hydrogen bonds with H2B, and their alteration is thought to contribute to nucleosomes instability
