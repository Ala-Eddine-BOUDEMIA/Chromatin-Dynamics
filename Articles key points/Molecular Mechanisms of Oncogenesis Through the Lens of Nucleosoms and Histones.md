# Oncohistones and Impacts of Cancer Mutations

- K27M substitutions in histone H3 are some of the first and most well-documented histone mutations in cancer patients.
- Recent reports demonstrate many cancer mutations in the acidic patch, possibly suggesting that histone mutations may contribute to oncogenic processes through the alteration of nucleosome interactions with other biomolecules.
- G53D mutations in H2B have been found in approximately 5% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cases.
- H2A.Z R80C have been shown in vitro studies to decrease nucleosome stability, congruent with its location at the important DNA binding site, where the arginine side chain is inserted into the DNA minor groove.
- G37E mutation in TSH2A.1 occurs at the same position as another cancer mutation G37D in canonical histone H2A; both of these mutations introduce the negatively charged amino acids at the end of the alpha-1 helix of the histone fold in H2A.
- Interestingly, this position also shows charge altering substitutions G → R in H2A.Z and G → E in H2A.P
- The H2B.W variant involved in spermatogenesis does not have any recurrent cancer mutations.
- Immunohistochemistry assays suggest that a loss of H1.3 and H1.5 may promote a histologically distinct B-cell lymphoma phenotype, with enhanced capacity for metastatic invasion.
- Glioma patients with H3K27M mutations generally exhibit shorter overall survival in comparison to those who do not harbor such mutations.

# Histone Variants in Cancer

- H2A.Z overexpression have been reported to be pro-oncogenic and are usually associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer.
- Increased expression of H2A.Z has been reported in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, liver, lung, and melanoma.
- An increase in acetylated H2A.Z forms and their mislocalization is another pathway employed by tumors. Particularly, in prostate cancer, androgen receptor (AR) signaling networks were shown to be activated by an increase of H2A.Zac at aberrantly formed neoenhancers of AR target genes.
- An increased expression of macroH2A.1 is correlated with less aggressive forms of breast cancer.
- Downregulation of macroH2A leads to cellular proliferation through activation of the CDK8 gene in both melanoma and breast cancer. MacroH2A downregulation is in turn caused by Skp2 overexpression, which promotes its degradation.
- High expression of γ-H2A.X is considered a poor prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.
- CENP-A overexpression is frequently found in cancer. For instance, it is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer and disease progression correlates with the CENP-A expression within a large patient cohort.

# Canonical Histone Isoforms in Cancer

- Currently, 10 isoforms are known for H2A, 12 for H2B, 2 for H3, and 2 for H4 canonical histones.
- The first observation showing the perturbation of histone isoform expression in cancer was reported for H2A genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In patients’ B-cells, the H2AC6 gene was shown to be overexpressed, while the H2AC4 and H2AC8 genes were underexpressed.
- Moreover, the expression levels of these genes changed with the level of cancer cell aggressiveness.
- The expression ratio between H2AC6 and H2AC12 isoforms was also found to differ between normal and liver tumor tissues.
- H2AC6 gene was found to be overexpressed in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer cells, where it was identified as a mediator for estradiol-dependent transcription of BCL2 and C-MYC oncogenes.
- H2AC20 gene was found to be a major regulator of EGF signaling in breast cancer.
- H4C7 gene has been shown to localize in nucleoli and enhance rDNA transcription. In breast cancer, the level of its expression correlates with the cancer progression stage, and in tumor xenograft models, H4G knockout leads to reduced tumorigenesis.
- Hypermethylation of the H2AC8 gene is correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas H2BC11 was found to be amplified, upregulated, and hypomethylated in brain metastasis of breast cancer.
