# Introduction

## Histone H3 Variants in the Context of Chromatin Organization

- **Chromatin displays hierarchical levels of organization**
- **The nucleosome is the basic repeat unit of chromatin.**
- **A nucleosome is DNA wrapped around a histone octamer.**
- **An octamer contains two molecules of each core histone.**
- **Nucleosomes are connected by linker histones.**
- Negative charges of the DNA phosphate backbone are neutralized by the basic charge of histones.
- Histones are not only structural proteins but also powerful modulators of all cellular functions exhibited by DNA.
- H3 variants fall into two subgroups :
    - Replicative histones (S phase, DSC, H3.1 & H3.2)
    - Replacement histones (DSI, H3.3 & CenH3)
- **Histone chaperones can be general or specific**, this could be attributed partly to differences in the amino acides sequence of the variants.
    - ASF1 & NASP : H3-H4
    - CAF-1 : H3.1 & H3.2
    - HIRA & DAXX/ATRX : H3.3
        - HIRA : Deposition at transient nucleosome-free regions
        - DAXX/ATRX : Enrichment at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres.
            - Residues 87 and 90 are sufficient to ensure a selective interaction
    - HJURP : CenH3 : Target its deposition at the centromere in a cell cycle-dependent manner.
- **The way histone variants connect to their chaperones may change in certain physiological or pathological situations.**

## The Case for Histone H3 Variants in Development and Disease

- **The identity of each cellular lineage is defined by its unique gene expression profile and its capacity to adapt this profile to the environment.**
- **Histone variants differential timing of incorporation and influence on chromatin structure offers direct control over numerous genomic functions that are critical during development.**
- Histone variants are versatile marks of :
    - Epigenetic nature
    - Signaling modules
- Centromere identity is determined by the presence of CenH3.

# H3 Dynamics During Preimplantation and Early Development

## Gametogenesis

- Gametogenesis gives rise to two distinct, **highly specialized cell types** the sperm and the oocyte, through meiosis and postmeiotic maturation.
- Drosophila melanogaster :
    - H3.3 has a role for fertility.
    - The expression of untagged H3.2 from the H3.3B promoter can rescue the infertility of H3.3A and B double mutants.
- Mice :
    - H3.3 is highly expressed in testes and ovaries
    - Hypomorphic or null H3.3A alleles decrease male fertility when homozygous
    - Loss of one of two copies of H3.3B disrupts sperm maturation and the homozygous knockout leads to complete infertility in males
    - In females, H3.3B knockout results in almost uniform infertility, and H3.3 is incorporated into the euchromatin regions of fully grown oocytes where it persists during meiosis.
    - H3.1 is absent from chromatin during oocyte maturation and the first part of preimplantation development.
- CenH3 is critical for centromere identity throughout metazoans and retaining the identity of this locus poses a challenge in the male germline.
- Meiotic recombination, chromatin remodeling to condense and reset the genome, and transcriptional inactivation in mature gametes all involve histone variant dynamics.
- H3 variants are essential for gametogenesis.

## Fertilization

- Both male and female genomes undergo differential reprogramming in the same cytoplasm to attain totipotency.
- H3.3 of maternal origin is globally deposited in the paternal chromatin upon fertilization.
- Mutation of H3.3 but not of replicative H3 at K27 results in aberrant accumulation of pericentric transcripts, heterochromatin protein 1 mislocalization, dysfunctional chromosome segregation, and developmental arrest.
- H3 variants can be exploited to both erase and reprogram existing chromatin marks, as well as to perpetuate the identity of a given genomic locus across generations.

## Early Development

- DSI and DSC modes of histone deposition are both necessary during development of vertebrate models.
- DSC during the first cell cycles relies on H3.2
- Depletion of CAF-1 p150 leads to complete loss of H3.1 and H3.2 and an increase in the incorporation of H3.3. Nevertheless, this compensatory mechanism is insufficient because embryos fail to develop into blastocytes.
- H3.3 knockdown induces arrest at the morula stage that can be rescued with wild-type H3, but not replicative H3 or an H3.3K36R mutant.
- Loss of H3.3K36 decreases H4K16 acetylation and leads to H1-mediated over condensation of the genome
- A balance between replicative and replacement H3 variant incorporation is crucial to maintain proper chromatin compaction during cleavage stages.

# H3 Dynamics During Cell Fate Specification

## Pluripotency and Reprogramming

- Mouse :
    - Donor cell-derived H3.1, H3.2, and H3.3 of the transplanted nucleus are rapidly replaced with maternal protein in a DSI manner
    - H3.1 is incorporated in NT embryos but not in fertilized ones
    - H3.3 seems to be dispensable for embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal. However, it becomes critical upon differentiation, with a significant impact on the expression of developmentally regulated bivalent genes
    - CenH3 CENP-A depletion is tolerated in ES cells, but not during differentiation.
    - There is a difference in the dynamics or functional importance of H3 variants for chromatin organization according to cell potency.
    - H3.3 may act as a barrier to prevent differentiation of ES cells into otherwise restricted cell lineages.
    - Given the antagonistic effects of H3.3 and H1 on chromatin compaction in the early embryo, changes in H3.3 distribution at developmentally regulated genes may not be mere consequences of transcription but could also play an upstream role by decreasing H1 binding and increasing template accessibility.

## Specific Differentiation Programs

- A gradual change from H3.2 to H3.3 occurs during chicken development which continues after hatching until H3.3 becomes predominant over H3.2 in tissues that stopped dividing.

### Mesoderm Induction

- H3.3 is critical for the proper expression of later mesodermal differentiation markers.

### Development of Mesodermal Derivatives

- Several steps in the pathway of muscle differentiation from mesodermal precursors require H3.3 deposition.
- In the murine C2C12 system H3.3 is incorporated in regulatory regions of the MyoD gene to enable its transcriptional activation in myotubes.
- Promoters of MyoD target genes also show H3.3 deposition before their activation-induced by differentiation.
- Little is known about CenH3 dynamics in the context of organogenesis but an increased level seems to be correlated with undifferentiated state and proliferative capacity.

### Neuronal Differentiation

- CAF-1 mediated deposition of replicative H3 is required in C.  elegans for the asymmetric cell division that forms the basis of bilateral asymmetry in the developing nervous system.
- Promoters that regulate neural tube mesenchyme and ear development in mouse rely on H3.3 incorporation to maintain adequate levels of H3K27me3.
- DAXX is associated with the regulatory regions of a subset of activity-regulated genes in murine cortical neural cells, where its calcium-dependent dephosphorylation regulates H3.3 loading and transcription upon neural activation.

# H3 Dynamics in Stress and Disease

## Cellular Response to Challenges in H3 Supply and Distribution

- A variety of cellular stress situations can affect the storage and deposition pathways of histone H3 variants.
- Depletion of ASF1 in human primary and cancer cells induces the formation of all hallmarks of the ALT mechanism, providing a new possible link between histone H3 dynamics and cancer.
- Impairing CAF-1-mediated H3.1 incorporation causes H3.3 deposition at replication sites via the HIRA complex in human HeLa cells in culture, but the inverse was not reported upon HIRA depletion.
- The over-expression of CenH3 CENP-A can lead to promiscuity in terms of histone-chaperone recognition and its incorporation at non-centromeric sites in the genome.

## Histone H3 Dynamics and Disease

- **Mutations in factors involved in nucleosome dynamics result in alterations of gene expression and can lead to changes in genome stability, in addition to the involvement of histone tail modifications in human disease.**
- **This raises the possibility that alterations in the network of histones, their chaperones, and histone-modifying enzymes may cause or reflect the progression of human disease.**
- The expression levels of a set of histone chaperones are increased in tumor samples, and their levels correlate with cancer progression :
    - ASF1b is a potential prognostic marker in breast cancer
    - p60 of the CAF1 complex was identified as a proliferation marker in various solid tumors with prognostic value in renal, endometrial and cervical cancers, prostatic cancer, melanoma, and salivary gland tumors and could be used as a marker in high-grade gliomas.
    - HJURP plays a crucial role in maintaining the high proliferative rate of high-grade glioma cells.
    - DAXX was identified as a predictor of early prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.
    - Over expression of CenH3 CENP-A can be associated with genome instability and was observed in colorectal cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer.
    - HJURP was reported to be over expressed in lung, and breast cancer, glioma, and astrocytoma and its levels correlate with progression and poorer prognosis.
- The prevalence and recurrent, missense nature of the mutations in genes encoding for H3.3 (H3F3A & H3F3B) are consistent with a positively selected driver effect, and the mechanism associating these mutations with tumorigenesis may involve altered gene expression, given that K27 and K36 are targets for methylation in the context of transcriptional regulation.
