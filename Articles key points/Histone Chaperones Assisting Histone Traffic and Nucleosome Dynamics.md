# Discovery and Definition of Histone Chaperones

- CAF-1 promotes nucleosome formation on newly replicated DNA

# Functional Classification of Histone Chaperones

- **A histone chaperone is a protein that associates with histones and is involved in their transfer but is not necessarily part of the final product.**
- In vitro, all histone chaperones promote a progressive transfer of purified histones onto naked DNA at physiological ionic strength to reconstitute nucleosomes from purified components
- In vivo, not all histone chaperones promote nucleosome assembly
- CAF-1 is a deposition factor that promotes assembly that is dependent on DNA synthesis
- HIRA is a deposition factor that promotes assembly that is independent on DNA synthesis
- ASF1 directly interacts with H3-H4 but does not necessarily have a direct role in nucleosome assembly in vivo
- ASF1 can relay histones to either CAF-1 or HIRA for subsequent deposition.

# Histone Chaperones and Their Histone Cargo

- Histone chaperone-histone interactions are not necessarily strict.
- That the histone chaperone NASP associates with H1 in mammal and is also an H3–H4 chaperone

# Structural Insights into Histone Binding and Variant Selectivity

- **The identification of acidic patches on several histone chaperones accords with the idea that histone chaperones play a general role in neutralizing the basicity of histones.**
- PTMs can aslo alter the electrostatic potential of the chaperone and affect histone binding.
- A characteristic histone-binding motif can be found as a signature on several chaperones
- The current model of ASF1 function at the replication fork proposes that :
    - Ahead of the fork, ASF1 handles histones from disrupted nucleosomes
    - Behind the fork, it delivers dimers to other deposition factors involved in assembly for both recycling and de novo deposition
- The structure shows that the divergent residues between histones H3.1 and H3.3 remain exposed to the solvent, enabling other chaperones to differentiate the variants bound to ASF1 and target them to particular deposition pathways, such as HIRA and CAF-1.

# Protecting H3-H4 from degradation : NASP

- Two forms of NASP :
    - Somatic : ubiquitously expressed.
    - Testicular : highly expressed in testes and ovaries as well as in transformed cells.
- Depletion or overexpression of NASP in human cells does not yield a strong change.
- Only during acute replication stress in human cells, when new soluble histones cannot be deposited onto DNA, does NASP become critical through a storage function.
- NASP fine-tunes the capacity of the H3-H4 reservoir through a mechanism that involves a dynamic balance between histone protection and degradation by chaperone- mediated autophagy

# Directing Histone Traffic: ASF1

- ASF1 is the most conserved eukaryotic H3-H4 chaperone.
- ASF1 synergizes with CAF-1 and HIRA to channel H3.1 and H3.3 histones into distinct deposition pathways.
- ASF1a and ASF1b (paralogs) are not functionally equivalent, as evidenced by different gene-expression patterns, different protein-protein interactions and the finding that the human paralogs rescue different defects in yeast depleted of yASF1.
- ASF1a interacts selectively with HIRA
- ASF1b has a preferential interaction for CAF-1 p60.

# CAF-1 De Novo Deposition of Replicative H3.1-H4 in a DNA Synthesis-Coupled Pathway

- CAF-1 is a key factor that deposits histones in a manner coupled to DNA replication and in DNA repair.
- p150, is crucial for coupling to DNA synthesis through an interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein. This interaction is promoted by the phosphorylation of CAF-1 p150 by Cdc7/Dbf4.
- The p60 subunit is also a substrate for phosphorylation by Cdk
- The presence of HIRA in a complex with RNA Pol2 supports its recruitment to transcription sites.
- Chromatin assembly coupled to DNA synthesis is more efficient than assembly independent of DNA synthesis

# Histone Chaperone Deposition of Replacement H3.3-H4 in a DNA Synthesis-Independent Pathway

- HIRA is a H3.3 chaperone that deposits this variant throughout interphase, independently of DNA synthesis.
- Bioinformatics approaches have been critical for the identification of ubinuclein 1 (UBN1) and calcineurin-binding protein 1 (CABIN1), the human orthologs of Hpc2p and Hir3p (yeast).
- DAXX mediates H3.3 loading at regulatory regions of select genes in which calcium and calcineurin dependent phosphorylation dynamics regulate DAXX chaperone activity.
- DAXX can associate with the α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) protein, which is also found in the soluble H3.3 complex. A member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of chromatin remodelers, ATRX may recruit DAXX activity to specific genomic loci.

# HJURP Deposits CENP-A in a Cell Cycle-Dependent Manner

- HJURP represents a prototype of a histone chaperone that can define a chromatin landmark by depositing a particular histone variant at a specific locus.
- The centromere is defined epigenetically by the presence of the H3 centromeric variant CENP-A.
- Newly synthesized CENP-A is deposited during late telophase and early G1 in human cells. This deposition timing coincided with the localization of HJURP at centromeres.
- Thus, during replication, new CENP-A is not deposited and the concentration of CENP-A is halved in each daughter cell, giving rise to questions about the composition of the centromeric particle post-replication.
- H3.3 may act as a placeholder and is later replaced by CENP-A in an HJURP-dependent manner.
- HJURP dimerization is required for CENP-A deposition; this property may ensure that centromeric nucleosome particles contain two copies of CENP-A (homotypic nucleosome), thereby contributing to the maintenance of this chromatin landmark

# Histone Chaperones Participate in Cross Talk

- the SNAP assay revealed possible cross talk between the HIRA and CAF-1 deposition pathways in human cells. CAF-1 p60 depletion allows HIRA to place H3.3 at replication foci where it does not normally go. However, the converse is not true, and CAF-1 does not compensate for the depletion of HIRA.
- No evidence has demonstrated cross-talk mechanisms for HIRA and DAXX.

# Histone Chaperones' Interface with Various DNA Processes at the Cellular Level: Adaptor Domains

- The presence of adapter domains can help recruit or localize histone chaperones to particular genomic loci or regulate chaperone activity for specific biological functions.
- CAF-1 interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and the histone lysine N-methyltransferase SetDB1. CAF-1 recruits these partners to defined chromosomal regions.
- The ability of HIRA to bind naked DNA suggests that HIRA may deposit H3.3 at transiently nucleosome-depleted regions, possibly to maintain genome integrity.
- Also, the presence of HIRA in a complex with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) supports its recruitment to transcription sites.
- DAXX, through its interaction with ATRX, is implicated in the enrichment of H3.3 at telomeres, in ribosomal DNA, and in embryonic stem cells.
- ATRX also recruits DAXX to pericentric heterochromatin.
- The use of adaptor domains can also regulate histone handling away from chromatin. ASF1 interacts with Codanin-1 through the same region that interacts with the B domain of HIRA and CAF-1.
- Codanin-1 is proposed to sequester ASF1 with histones in the cytoplasm, which would prevent ASF1 from donating histones to CAF-1 and HIRA for subequent deposition.

# Histone Chaperones' Role During Replication: Handling Histones at the Fork

- Recycling and de novo deposition must be coordinated because the inheritance of chromatin marks can dictate cell fate.
- ASF1, in escorting both parental and newly synthesized histones, may help coordinate these processes.
- During de novo assembly, newly synthesized H3.1–H4 histones associated with ASF1 can be handed off to CAF-1 for subsequent deposition.
- For recycling, ASF1 complexed with the MCM2-7 helicase may handle evicted parental histones and direct their distribution onto the daughter strands.

# Histone Chaperones' Participation During Transcription

- Following the passage of RNA Pol II, the reassembly of nucleosomes restores the chromatin structure, preventing cryptic transcription; ASF1, FACT, and Spt6 may facilitate this process.
- The targeting of histone chaperones to transcription sites may occur through interactions with the transcriptional machinery or transcription-associated chromatin marks by the use of the adapter domains. For example, human Spt6 and HIRA have been found in complex with RNA Pol II, and ASF1 associates with TAFII250, the largest subunit of the TFIID transcription factor.
