# Introduction

- **Selection of histone variants and their handling by distinct histone chaperones (architects) contribute to the marking of specific genomic locations during various cell cycle phases**.
- **A network of assembly lines involving chaperone–variant interactions regulates chromatin organization in various developmental stages and disease states.**
- Histone variants, histone-modifying enzymes (that catalyze distinct PTMs [posttranslational modifications] on histone variants), and chromatin remodeling factors are constituents of defined complexes that organize chromatin.
- Furthermore, these large, multicomponent complexes bring together transcription factors, chromatin-associated proteins, and DNA-modifying enzymes to interface with bricks and architects
- CAF-1 mutant animals display heterochromatin disorganization and arrest during early embryonic development.
- **Interestingly, at the transcriptional level, cancers also often display alterations in the expression of histone regulators including key histone variants and chaperones**
- A series of cancer types show up-regulation of Asf1b, one of the two human paralogs of the Asf1 chaperone
- Overexpression of CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone variant, or its cognate histone chaperone HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein) is a hallmark of tumor progression and poor prognosis.

# H3 Variant Dynamics: Variations on a Theme in the 4D Nucleus

- In humans, eight H3 variants have been identified to date
- HIRA deposits H3.3 at gene bodies, promoters, and regulatory elements
- Asf1 influences chromosome stability at distinct landmarks, such as chromosome ends, by regulating telomere length maintenance
- NASP (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein) acts as an emergency reservoir of soluble histones
- MCM2 (DNA replication licensing factor, a component of the DNA helicase), newly identified as a histone chaperone, coordinates parental histone recycling at the replisome

# Altered Dosage of Architects and Bricks Potentiates Tumorigenesis: From Mouse Models to Human Pathology

- Epigenetic factors may be altered as a consequence of cancer-causing mutations, without themselves being mutated
- A genetic defect in the tumor suppressor p53 selectively up-regulates centromeric histone variant CENP-A and its chaperone HJURP in cancers of different origins
- CENP-A and HJURP levels are co-regulated through a dual control mechanism involving both transcriptional and posttranslational modes

# A Central Role for Histone Variants in Development

- Point mutations in human H3 variants, such as K27M and G34R/V, or their associated chaperones are linked to aggressive pediatric glioblastoma.
