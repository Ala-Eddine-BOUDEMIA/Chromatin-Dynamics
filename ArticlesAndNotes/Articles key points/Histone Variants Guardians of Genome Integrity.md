# Histone Variants Safeguard Chromosomal Integrity

- ATRX deficiency in human cells induces oncogenic-associated telomere dysfunction unraveling the fundamental role of the H3.3 chaperone complex DAXX-ATRX in the maintenance of telomere integrity.

# Histone Variants and Cancer

- Importantly, the H3.1 and H3.3 point mutations do not affect residues involved in histone chaperone binding and thus do not alter the deposition patterns of these oncohistones into chromatin as shown for the K27M mutation
- The in trans effect of H3 variant mutants derives from their ability to inhibit specific histone modifying enzymes: K27M transient interaction with the H3K27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) poisons this enzyme and prevents spreading of H3K27me3 from their nucleation sites, thus strongly reducing genome-wide H3K27me3 levels
- K36M traps the H3K36 methyltransferases SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (NSD2) and affects H3K36me3 levels
- G34R inhibits H3K9/K36 demethylases of the KDM4 family
- Through alteration of histone PTMs, H3 variant oncomutations act as dominant negative, gain-of-function mutations that affect transcriptional programs
- H3.1K27M inhibits NHEJ of DSBs in human fibroblasts
- H3.3K36M instead inhibits DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR) in human cells, with consequences on genome stability
- Noteworthy, even though H3.1 and H3.3 variants can bear identical amino acid substitutions in cancer, there are significant differences between these mutated histone variants. For instance, H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M are differentially distributed in chromatin and H3.1K27M results in stronger reduction of H3K27me3 levels
- H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M also promote distinct oncogenic transcriptional programs in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) involving variant-specific patterns of active enhancers
- H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M DIPGs are histologically and clinically distinct: H3.3K27M tumors have a later onset but are more aggressive and more resistant to radiotherapy than H3.1K27M tumors
- R4H, K16T, E57Q in H2A; G27A, E36G, M63K, E76K in H2B. These mutations were shown to alter genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression, possibly by affecting PTMs, because lysine and arginine are modifiable residues, or histoneâ€“histone interactions
