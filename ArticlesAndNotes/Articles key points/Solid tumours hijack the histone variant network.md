# Introduction

- **Oncohistones:** Missense mutations in a histone variant, most commonly H3.3, often altering a key post-translational modification site that leads to a tumorigenic gene expression programme driving specific malignancies in children or young adults.
- What sets histone variants apart from their canonical counterparts is their unique biophysical properties, genomic localization patterns and binding partners, conferred by differences in primary amino acid sequence and structure

# The H2A Histone Family

## H2A.Z

- Overall, H2A.Z has been associated with transcriptional activation, possibly due to the presence of an extended acidic patch that decreases the electrostatic interaction between DNA and histone. Additionally, H2A.Z can co-occur with H3.3 in the same nucleosome, generating a highly salt-labile particle enriched at regions of high histone turnover, which likely facilitates the access of transcription factors to the underlying DNA. Similarly to other histones, H2A.Z is subjected to PTMs such as acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation that differentially modulate gene expression; for example, hyperacetylated H2A.Z is found near transcription start sites (TSSs) and at enhancers of active genes, correlating with transcriptional activation
- Deposition of H2A.Z into specific genomic regions is achieved by either of the ATP-dependent chaperone complexes SNF2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP) or p400–TIP60
- Eviction of H2A.Z is orchestrated by the INO80 and ANP32E chaperone complexes. ANP32E has been shown to negatively regulate H2A.Z enrichment around the TSS, at enhancers and at insulators, while both the ANP32E and INO80 complexes remove H2A.Z from sites of DNA damage to allow efficient homologous recombination
- While H2A.Z.1 and H2AZ.2 are not frequently mutated, their expression is commonly upregulated in several tumour types
- Acetylated H2A.Z can drive abnormal gene expression, and TIP60 has been implicated in acetylating H2A.Z in ARE regions near enhancers
- In both breast cancer and prostate cancer, H2A.Z.1 drives transcription of key oncogenic factors and its function is modulated by its PTM status.
- Components of the SRCAP complex, including the SRCAP helicase, YL1, GAS41, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, are upregulated in several tumours, such as ovarian tumours, breast tumours, thyroid tumours, prostate tumours, melanoma, bladder tumours and glioma
- GAS41 is essential to modulate deposition of H2A.Z at cell cycle and DNA replication genes in non-small-cell lung cancer cells, where it promotes expression of these genes, and in turn, proliferation
- The level of the TIP60 subunit of the p400–TIP60 complex is also altered in cancer. In contrast with subunits of the SRCAP complex however, TIP60 exhibits a tumour-suppressive role.

## MacroH2A

- MacroH2A variants are enriched on the inactive X chromosome, in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, on repetitive DNA sequences and at inactive genes, and often colocalize with H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 genomic occupancy, collectively suggesting a role in transcriptional repression and heterochromatin structure
- Like H2A.Z, macroH2A expression is altered in cancer, but the genes encoding macroH2A variants are not frequently mutated
- MacroH2A levels are decreased in tumours relative to normal tissues across a spectrum of cancers
- Increased expression of FACT is associated with poorly differentiated and more aggressive tumours, such as triple-negative breast cancer and HER2+ breast cancer

# The H3 Histone Family

## H3.3

- Numerous gene expression programmes induced during development involve H3.3 deposition at promoters and enhancers
- H3.3 deposited by DAXX–ATRX at repetitive elements forms a substrate for K9 trimethylation to ensure silencing of telomeric repeat RNA and retrotransposition
- H3.3 may also contribute to tumour progression through changes in its levels. For example, the balance between H3.3 and replicative H3 deposition could modulate metastatic behaviour through transcriptional reprogramming

## DAXX/ATRX mutations

- Mutations in the H3.3 chaperone complex DAXX-ATRX are common in tumours of neural or neural crest origin, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, glioma and neuroblastoma
- Upregulation of DAXX carries a negative prognostic value in prostate and ovarian cancer
- ATRX interacts with macroH2A to exclude it from subtelomeric regions and contributes to silencing of the inactive X chromosome and PRC2 target genes
